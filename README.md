# Arduino
Arduino fun with the Arduino Starter Kit and more.<br>
I am learning about and experimenting with Arduino for fun in my free time.
This all started when I first wanted to make my own guitar pedal, and decided that learning how to use Arduino would be a good start.
As my interests diverged while exploring Arduino, I discovered other fun ways to learn via several different Arduino-community projects.

My goal with Arduino is to learn how to make a simple, 8-bit game, make a guitar pedal, and who knows what else!
